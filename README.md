# Discord_Fork
The public Discord lists you fork to add your content to or find something you desire.<br>
Website URL: https://discordfork.info/

NOTE: Please do not complain over how *bad* the site is made, this is mostly made as a
way to be more unique and prove that a list site can possibly be made with Jekyll.

## Adding your bot to the site
- Fork the project
- Add a new file in **\_bots** with `your_bot_name.md` and add the following:
```md
---
botname: BOT NAME
description: DESCRIPTION (limited to 60 characters)
long_description: LONG_DESCRIPTION (only viewable at bot page)
avatar: URL, must be the Discord avatar in PNG format and no ?size query
link: URL to invite bot, must be HTTPS
site: (optional) Site URL
nsfw: true | false
---
After this line, you can do any markdown code you want for custom page!
```
- make a PR and wait for answers
